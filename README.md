# PictoNet

**PictoNet** is an open and public initiative led by [MediaFranca](https://github.com/mediafranca). It aims to develop a generative pictogram system to support individuals with complex communication needs (CCN), with a particular focus on cognitive accessibility, cultural responsiveness, and self-determination.

This repository hosts the preliminary development of the core engine for pictogram generation. The project is in an early research and prototyping phase and is not yet suitable for production use.

## Project Goals

- Develop a generative model capable of producing semantically coherent pictograms from textual input.
- Create a public infrastructure for dataset sharing, model evaluation, and interface testing.
- Encourage collaborative contributions from the research, AAC, and design communities.

## Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned development milestones for the PictoNet project:

1. **Identification of Foundational Models**  
   Evaluation of suitable architectures for text-to-image generation and symbolic reasoning, with emphasis on interpretability and SVG output.

2. **Dataset Generation and Curation**  
   - Construction of training datasets combining visual, linguistic, and contextual information.  
   - Validation and expert curation to ensure consistency, usability, and inclusivity of generated outputs.

3. **Development of RLHF Interface**  
   - Design and implementation of a Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) interface for iterative model improvement.  
   - Integration of community feedback and expert annotations to guide model fine-tuning.
